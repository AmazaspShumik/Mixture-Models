##  Hierarchical Mixture of Experts

Hierarchical mixture of experts can be used to solve standard [regression](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-of-Experts-Models/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Mixture%20of%20Experts/hme_standard_regression_examples.ipynb) and [classification](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-of-Experts-Models/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Mixture%20of%20Experts/hme_classification_examples.ipynb) problems, however one of the main applications of hme are problems with [multimodal output](https://github.com/AmazaspShumik/Mixture-of-Experts-Models/blob/master/Hierarchical%20Mixture%20of%20Experts/hme_multimodal_output_examples.ipynb).
